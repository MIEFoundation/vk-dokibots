# VK Dokibots

Sayori, Yuri and Natsuki bots for VKontakte.
Error-tolerant and easy to use.

## Setup

- Install dependencies: `npm i` (`pnpm` packet manager is recommended)

- Set environment variable `TOKEN` as `sayori=AA,yuri=BB,natsuki=CC`

- If you don't specify access token for specific doki - it will be ignored and app will run without it.
